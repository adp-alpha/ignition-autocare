# Booking System Integration - Complete ✅

## ⚡ REFACTORED: Unavailable Slots Approach

The system has been **refactored** to use a more scalable approach:
- **Only unavailable slots are stored** in the database
- **All slots are available by default** unless explicitly marked as unavailable
- **Slots are generated dynamically** based on business rules
- **Closed days** (recurring or specific) are stored separately

### Why This Approach?

✅ **Scalability**: No need to pre-create thousands of slots  
✅ **Flexibility**: Easy to change working hours without database updates  
✅ **Performance**: Smaller database, faster queries  
✅ **Simplicity**: Only manage exceptions, not the norm

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Database Schema** ✅

#### **Customer** 
- Stores customer information with email indexing

#### **Booking**
- Complete booking records with structured service data
- **Stores booking date and time directly** (no slot reference)
- Fields: `bookingDate`, `startTime`, `endTime`, `displayTime`

#### **UnavailableSlot** 
- Specific time slots that are unavailable
- Unique constraint on `date + startTime + endTime`
- Reason field for why it's unavailable

#### **ClosedDay**
- Garage closure management (specific dates & recurring)
- Supports recurring closures (e.g., "Every Sunday")

#### **SlotConfiguration**
- Configurable slot settings and business rules
- `slotsPerTimeSlot`: How many bookings can be made for the same time
- Dynamic slot generation parameters

#### **BookingStatus**
- Enum for booking lifecycle management

### 2. **Type Definitions** ✅
Created comprehensive TypeScript types in `/types/booking.ts`:
- `BookingServicesData` - Structured service selection data
- `CreateBookingRequest` - Complete booking request format
- `BookingResponse` - API response format
- `AvailableSlot` - Slot availability data
- Individual service types (MOT, Service, Delivery, etc.)

### 3. **API Endpoints** ✅

#### GET `/api/slots/available`
- **Generates available slots dynamically** based on:
  - Slot configuration (working hours, days, duration)
  - Closed days (specific and recurring)
  - Unavailable slots
  - Existing bookings (capacity check)
- Returns slots grouped by date with availability info
- **No pre-created slots needed**

#### POST `/api/bookings/create`
- Creates new bookings with transaction safety
- **Checks capacity dynamically** by counting existing bookings
- Generates unique booking references (IGN-YYYYMMDD-XXX)
- Syncs to Google Calendar
- Handles customer deduplication by email
- **Validates against unavailable slots and closed days**

#### GET `/api/bookings/create?reference=XXX`
- Retrieves booking by reference number

### 4. **Service Mapper** ✅
`/lib/booking-service-mapper.ts`:
- Maps booking context to structured service data
- Preserves all pricing, discount, and metadata information
- Creates display-friendly summaries

### 5. **Google Calendar Integration** ✅
`/lib/google-calendar.ts`:
- Automatic event creation with full booking details
- **Updated to use booking's date/time fields directly**
- Email notifications to customers
- Reminders (24h and 1h before)
- Event update and cancellation support

### 6. **Confirmation Page Integration** ✅
Updated `/components/confirm/ConfirmationPageClient.tsx`:
- **Dynamic Slot Loading** - Fetches real slots from API
- **Calendar UI** - Shows only available dates
- **Time Slot Selection** - Displays capacity-aware time slots
- **Loading States** - Proper loading and error handling
- **Form Validation** - Validates all required fields
- **Booking Submission** - Submits to API with proper error handling
- **Success Feedback** - Shows booking reference on success

### 7. **Seed Scripts** ✅
`/prisma/seed-slots.ts`:
- **Only seeds configuration and exceptions**
- Creates slot configuration with business rules
- Adds recurring closed days (e.g., Sundays)
- Adds specific closed dates (e.g., holidays, training days)
- Optionally adds example unavailable slots

### 8. **Utilities** ✅
`/lib/booking-utils.ts`:
- `generateBookingReference()` - Unique reference generation
- `formatServicesForDisplay()` - Service formatting for calendar/emails
- `validateBookingRequest()` - Request validation

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env)
```bash
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILE=./electric-rhino-473503-g0-4ee3284c26d4.json
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID=primary
```

### Slot Configuration (Database)
Default settings:
- **Slot Duration**: 120 minutes (2 hours)
- **Working Hours**: 08:00 - 17:00
- **Working Days**: Monday - Saturday
- **Slots Per Time Slot**: 1 booking
- **Lead Time**: 1 day minimum
- **Booking Window**: 60 days maximum

Time slots generated dynamically:
- 08:00 - 10:00
- 10:00 - 12:00
- 13:00 - 15:00
- 15:00 - 17:00

## Database Migration

Migration applied: `20251012065129_refactor_to_unavailable_slots`

**Changes:**
- Removed `BookingSlot` table
- Added `UnavailableSlot` table
- Updated `Booking` table to store date/time directly
- Updated `SlotConfiguration` (`defaultCapacity` → `slotsPerTimeSlot`)
- Migrated existing booking data from slots

**Tables:**
- `customers`
- `bookings` (updated structure)
- `unavailable_slots` (new)
- `closed_days`
- `slot_configurations` (updated)

---

## Seeded Data

- **1 slot configuration** (active)
- **2 closed days** (Sundays recurring + 1 specific date)
- **1 example unavailable slot**
- **No pre-created slots** (generated on-demand)

---

## How It Works

### User Journey:
1. **User selects vehicle** → Navigates to services page
2. **Selects services** → Price calculated in real-time
3. **Clicks "Continue to Booking"** → Goes to confirm page
4. **Confirm page loads** → Fetches available slots from `/api/slots/available`
   - API generates slots dynamically for next 60 days
   - Excludes closed days (Sundays, holidays)
   - Excludes unavailable slots
   - Excludes fully booked slots
5. **User selects date** → Calendar shows only available dates
6. **User selects time slot** → Shows slots with capacity info
7. **User fills details** → First name, last name, email, phone
8. **User clicks "Confirm Booking"** → 
   - Maps services to structured data
   - Sends POST to `/api/bookings/create`
   - Database transaction:
     - Checks slot is not unavailable
     - Checks day is not closed
     - Counts existing bookings for capacity
     - Creates/updates customer
     - Generates booking reference
     - Creates booking record with date/time
   - Syncs to Google Calendar
   - Returns booking reference
9. **Success!** → Shows confirmation with reference number

### Data Flow:
```
BookingContext (selected services + pricing)
    ↓
BookingServiceMapper (structures the data)
    ↓
CreateBookingRequest (complete booking payload)
    ↓
API /bookings/create (validates & saves)
    ↓
Check Unavailable Slots & Closed Days
    ↓
Count Existing Bookings (capacity check)
    ↓
Database Transaction (atomic)
    ↓
Google Calendar Event (async)
    ↓
BookingResponse (confirmation)
```

### Slot Generation Logic:
```
FOR each date in range:
  IF date is closed (specific or recurring) → SKIP
  IF day of week not in working days → SKIP
  
  FOR each time slot (based on config):
    slotKey = date + startTime + endTime
    
    IF slotKey in unavailable_slots → SKIP
    
    existingBookings = COUNT bookings WHERE
      date = slotKey.date AND
      startTime = slotKey.startTime AND
      endTime = slotKey.endTime AND
      status NOT IN (CANCELLED, NO_SHOW)
    
    IF existingBookings >= slotsPerTimeSlot → SKIP
    
    → ADD to available slots
```
